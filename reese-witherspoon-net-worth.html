Reese Witherspoon’s net worth is estimated to be about $400 million according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes.&nbsp;</a></p><p>In 2021, Forbes named her the richest actress in the world after her production company Hello Sunshine sold to Blackstone. The company was valued at $900 at the time and Witherspoon retained an ownership stake of at least 18% and collected $120 million after taxes. “I started this company to change the way all women are seen in media,” Witherspoon said in a statement. “Over the past few years, we have watched our mission thrive through books, TV, film, and social platforms. Today, we’re taking a huge step forward by partnering with&nbsp;@blackstone, which will enable us to tell even more entertaining, impactful, and illuminating stories about women’s lives globally.”</p><p>“There just wasn’t a spectrum of storytelling for women that I felt was representative of the world that we walk through and that our daughters are seeing on film and television,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Parade</a> about what it was like working in Hollywood. “The emergence of streaming and the confluence of deciding to start a company, I guess I was psychic. I had no idea the whole world would open up for us, but it has changed my <a href=# rel=nofollow>life</a>.” She added, “The ability to work with different storytellers, to be able to option books and partner with other people I respect and admire who also have a perspective that is not my own, but is just as valuable, has changed my entire experience. Now, I primarily generate everything that I do.”</p><p>She also revealed that her ex-husband Jim Toth helped her make the decision to be a producer as well as an actress. “He said, ‘You should produce movies,'” Witherspoon <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-product-module=body_link data-analytics-post-depth=40 data-uri=5cc66416366df348d3862dbaf88dafbb>told Harper’s Bazaar in 2016</a>. “‘You read more books than anybody I know. You should just buy some of them and turn them into films.'”</p><p>She’s also expanded into running Reese’s Book Club which has over 2.1 million followers and 42 out of its 50 picks have made their way to the New York Times Best Sellers list.</p><h2>How much does Reese Witherspoon make from acting?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/reese-witherspoon.jpg><p>How much does Reese Witherspoon make from acting?

In a statement shared onto their <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a> on March 24, 2023, Witherspoon and Jim Toth announced their separation. “We have some personal news to share… It is with a great deal of care and consideration that we have made the difficult decision to divorce,” they said. “We have enjoyed so many wonderful years together and are moving forward with deep love, kindness and mutual respect for everything we have created together.” “Our biggest priority is our son and our entire family as we navigate this next chapter,” they added. “These matters are never easy and are extremely personal. We truly appreciate everyone’s respect for our family’s privacy at this time.”</p><p>On April 1, 2023,<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> People</a> obtained the divorce documents where the Legally Blonde actress cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for their divorce when she filed Saturday in the Circuit Court of Davidson County, Tennesee.</p><p>A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> about their living situation. “They love [their son] Tennessee, and this is their focus. The move from Los Angeles to Nashville was a big deal for him. They don’t want the divorce to affect him negatively. They will continue to co-parent amicably. There is no drama.” Another source told the site, “This is such an amicable decision. They are so committed to co-parenting together.

Reese divorced her first husband Ryan Philippe in 2006 and reportedly did not have a prenup in place.</p><p>The couple reportedly made millions in real estate. Just last year, Reese Witherspoon sold one Los Angeles home for $21.5 million after buying it in $16 million in 2020.
