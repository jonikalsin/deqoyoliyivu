And, that includes six major championships: three Masters titles (2004, 2006, 2010), two PGA Championships (2005, 2021), and one Open Championship (2013). Likewise, with his win at the 2021 PGA Championship, he became the oldest major championship winner in history at the age of 51 years.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-142758 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Phil-Mickelson-The-New-York-Times.jpg alt="Phil Mickelson" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-142758 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Phil holding and posing with the Wanamaker Trophy after winning the P.G.A.
