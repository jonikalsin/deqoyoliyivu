They sent him to his first major tournament, the World Championship for boys aged 9 and 10 at the Doral Golf Resort in Miami, where he emerged as the winner.</p><h2><span id=Rory_McIlroys_Early_Golf_Success>Rory McIlroy’s Early Golf Success</span></h2><p>Rory McIlroy achieved tremendous success in golf at a young age.
