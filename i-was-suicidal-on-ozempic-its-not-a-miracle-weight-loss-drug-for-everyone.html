It was just nonstop thinking about food in terms of not eating enough,” she said. “I’d be so stressed out because I had no appetite and then I wasn’t eating, which caused my anxiety to get worse and I started to feel guilty about how little I was eating. It was just like a continuous vicious cycle.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">“GLP-1 (the hormone that semaglutide mimics) is produced while we eat; it tells the brain that we are full,” Dr. Katherine H. Saunders, a New York City physician, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told The Post</a>. “It helps people to feel less hungry, to feel full faster, and to stay full longer — but it does so when we are actually less full.” <span class=credit>REUTERS</span></figure><p>Despite increasingly mainstream, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">celebrity-hyped usage</a>, Ozempic and similar injectables have led to a <a href=#>spike in ER visits.</a> The long list of disturbing side effects includes&nbsp;prematurely<a href=#> aging faces</a> and<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;</a><a href=#>drooping butts</a>, spontaneous <a href=#>diarrhea</a> while sleeping and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stomach paralysis</a>. Ozempic is also noted for <a href=#>its ability to stop food fantasies</a>, or, as some on social media have dubbed them, “food noise.”</p><p>“So many people praise the aspect of quieting the ‘food noise,’ whereas for me that caused me so much mental stress,” Amelia said. “It almost became obsessive. Like, every day I would spiral and was constantly thinking about how little I was eating, and how terrible that made me feel.”</p><p>She eventually turned back to social media to find validation —&nbsp;and discovered others who claimed to also have experienced anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation with taking Ozempic.</p><p>The US<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Food and Drug Administration’s adverse event reporting system</a> received 190 reports&nbsp;of depression and suicide-related mental illnesses connected to Ozempic,&nbsp;along with 84 reports connected to Saxenda and 26 to Wegovy as of June 30.</p><p>Meanwhile, European drug safety regulators <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">officially launched an investigation</a> of Ozempic, Saxenda and Wegovy after<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> patients reported that the medicine triggered</a> thoughts of suicide and self-harm.</p><p>&nbsp;All three drugs are manufactured by Novo Nordisk. A representative for the pharmaceutical company<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;said</a> “Novo Nordisk remains committed to ensuring patient safety,” however, “the safety data collected from large clinical-trial programs and post-marketing surveillance have not demonstrated a causal association between semaglutide or liraglutide and suicidal and self-harming thoughts.”</p><p>Amelia eventually addressed her concerns with her doctor and insisted on a lower dosage. Since switching to the lowest possible amount in June, Amelia told The Post her appetite returned and her mental health drastically improved.</p><p>The FDA requires that medications for weight management that work on the central nervous system, including Saxenda and Wegovy, carry a warning about suicidal thoughts. Ozempic, which is only FDA-approved to treat diabetes, does not come with that warning.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Saxenda warns users of the possible mental health side effects, Leigh — a 27-year-old special education teacher who spoke to The Post — was not prepared for the extent of the impact. The Philadelphia native was shocked at how the change in her relationship with food altered her mental state.</p><p>Leigh told The Post the drug, which she was prescribed to manage her weight, “completely took the pleasure out of food,” shrinking her appetite and making most foods seem undesirable or nauseating.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">“People put so much emotion and hope into weight loss,” Dr. Alexis Conason, a licensed psychologist in NYC, told The Post. “And are sold this fantasy that if they just lose weight everything’s gonna be okay and all the good things that they want in life will come when they lose weight.” <span class=credit>NY Post composite</span></figure><p>“When you’re really desperate to lose weight you think, ‘Oh, I wish I didn’t have pleasure from food’ and ‘I wish that I didn’t love food so much like that would be so great. Then I could just, like, not eat that much and all the weight would fall off.’ But the second that that pleasure is taken away, that’s not what you want,” she insisted.</p><p>Leigh said she felt a lot of shame for taking a medication to lose weight, hiding it from her friends and lying to her family that she had a medical condition that required the prescription.</p><p>“I was blaming myself like, ‘Oh, my God, I let myself gain so much weight that this is what I have to do to my body,” she admitted. “I felt like this was a last resort.”</p><p>Two months into taking the daily injections, Leigh nearly quit her job, was avoiding hanging out with her friends and “never wanted to do anything.” Her family and boyfriend eventually expressed their concern and Leigh decided to stop taking the medication and work on intuitive eating with a nutritionist. She’s already feeling much better.</p><p>While many people are surprised by the connection between these medicalized weight loss and mental health, medical experts are not.</p><p>Research has shown that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bariatric surgery patients have an increased risk for suicide and self-harm behaviors</a> following the procedure. Lead study author Dr. Alexis Conason, a licensed psychologist in NYC, noted that triggering experiences such as changes in quality of life and unrealistic expectations also occur to those going through other weight loss treatments such as Ozempic.</p><p>“People put so much emotion and hope into weight loss, and are sold this fantasy that if they just lose weight everything’s gonna be okay and all the good things that they want in life will come when they lose weight,” Conason told The Post.</p><p>It can be devastating when that doesn’t happen.</p><p>“It’s not necessarily surprising when you see there may be an increase in suicidal ideation and other things like that because you’ve taken away a really important coping mechanism for many people,” Brooke Boyarsky Pratt, CEO and co-founder of weight-inclusive care company<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>&nbsp;Knownwell</a>, told The Post.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">A shortage of Wegovy is making it hard for diabetics to get their meds in a timely manner —&nbsp;as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">more employers are cutting off insurance coverage</a> for costly the weight-loss drugs, which can cost up to $1,350 a month. <span class=credit>REUTERS</span></figure><p>Dr. Gregory Dodell&nbsp;of Central Park Endocrinology also noted that patients on medications that suppress their appetite may not be getting sufficient nutrients, which in turn disrupts their mental stability.</p><p>“So much of balancing our body is about what we eat and drink,” he told The Post.</p><p>That’s why some experts, including Dr. Angela Fitch, president of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Obesity Medicine Association</a>, recommend patients taking medications that result in weight loss seek comprehensive care, monitor both physical and mental health and be fully educated on realistic expectations and all possible side effects.</p><p>“Setting expectations and weight management is a huge problem in our country,” Fitch told The Post.</p><p>If you are struggling with suicidal thoughts or are experiencing a mental health crisis and live in New York City, you can call 1-888-NYC-WELL for free&nbsp;and&nbsp;confidential crisis counseling.&nbsp;If you live outside the five boroughs, call or text 988 or chat&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">988lifeline.org</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fmamxfnnq4rdJmqq6hk56xoriMqKVmp6qaurG1wmagratdo7y1ecBmpKKqkZi5pnnWnqCgoKRiubC%2F0mabq62XYrOwvoyerZ6qqaS7pns%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-was-suicidal-on-ozempic-its-not-a-miracle-weight-loss-drug-for-everyone.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fi-was-suicidal-on-ozempic-its-not-a-miracle-weight-loss-drug-for-everyone.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fi-was-suicidal-on-ozempic-its-not-a-miracle-weight-loss-drug-for-everyone.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fi-was-suicidal-on-ozempic-its-not-a-miracle-weight-loss-drug-for-everyone.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-was-suicidal-on-ozempic-its-not-a-miracle-weight-loss-drug-for-everyone.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-was-suicidal-on-ozempic-its-not-a-miracle-weight-loss-drug-for-everyone.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jess-hilarious.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jess-hilarious.html>Jess Hilarious -
