He is<strong> 65 years old</strong> and is under the astrological sign, Aries. He holds British nationality and his full name is Benjamin Obadiah Iqbal Zephaniah.</p><p>The name of Benjamin’s parents is not available at the moment. However, he is the son of a Barbadian postman and a Jamaican nurse. He also has a sibling and their name is Velda Zephaniah. And, his parents raised him in the Handsworth district of Birmingham, England, which he calls the “Jamaican capital of Europe”. Talking about his childhood, he is a dyslexic and attended an approved school but left when he was 13 years old as he was unable to read or write. And, Zephaniah attended Broadway Academy.</p><p>During that time, he was given an old, manual typewriter which he says inspired him to become a writer. His manual typewriter is now in the collection of Birmingham Museums Trust. Likewise, when he was young, he received a criminal record and served a prison sentence for burglary.</p><h2><span id=Career_and_Professional_Life>Career and Professional Life</span></h2><p>Benjamin Zephaniah’s poetry is strongly influenced by the music and poetry of Jamaica and what he calls “street politics”. And, his first performance was in church when he was 11 years old, and by the age of 15, his poetry was already popular among Handsworth’s Afro-Caribbean and Asian communities. But his poetry was limited to black people only and as he was tired of the limitations, he decided to expand his audience and headed to London when he was 22 years old.</p><p>Likewise, Benjamin was able to become actively involved in a workers’ cooperative in Stratford, London. This then led to the publication of his first book of poetry, “Pen Rhythm (Page One Books, 1980)”. He also stated that his mission is to fight the dead image of poetry in academia and to “take [it] everywhere” to people who do not read books, so he turned poetry readings into concert-like performances. Moreover, his other collections of poetry are “The Dread Affair: Collected Poems (1985)” and “Rasta Time in Palestine (1990)”.</p><p>Also, he was a poet in residence at the chambers of Michael Mansfield QC and sat in on the inquiry into Bloody Sunday and other cases. These experiences led to his Too Black, Too Strong poetry collection (2001), We Are Britain! (2002), and many others. Also, his first book of poetry for children was Talking Turkeys in the year 1994. And, in the year 1999, he wrote a novel for teenagers, Face, the first of four novels to date. Also, in the year 2016, he was able to write the forward to Angry White People: Coming Face-to-face with the British Far-right by Hsiao-Hung Pai.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-189442 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Benjamin-Zephaniah-QnA.jpg alt="Benjamin Zephaniah" width=650 height=341 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-189442 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Benjamin Zephaniah during QnA (Source: The Guardian)</p><h4>More About Career</h4><p>Benjamin Zephaniah made many minor appearances in several TV programs in the 1980s and 1990s, including The Bill, The Comic Strip Presents, and Crucial Tales.
