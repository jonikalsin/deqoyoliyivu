She played Joanna Locasto, the lead character on the NBC drama series <i>Deception.</i> She starred in the 2013 comedy <i>Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues</i> and has earned a reputation as a scream queen, having starred in the horror films <i>Venom</i> (2005), <i>One Missed Call</i> (2008), <i>Saw V</i> (2008), and <i>The Unborn</i> (2009).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/meagan-good-6f043347-cd28-44a8-82d8-6cbfa29a33e-resize-750.jpeg><span itemprop=thumbnail itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject></span><h2 class="alchetronTopicHeaderClass mw-headline" id=Jumping-the-broom-6-movie-clip-it-s-burning-2011-hd>Jumping the broom 6 movie clip it s burning 2011 hd</h2><br><h2 class=alchetronTopicHeaderClass id=Early-life>Early life</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/meagan-good-16188f49-44cd-4f2f-8eba-9aa7444a04e-resize-750.jpeg><p>Good was born on August 8, 1981, in Panorama City, Los Angeles, California. Her mother, Tyra Wardlow-Doyle, worked as Good's manager into her teens, and her father, Leondis "Leon" Good, is an LAPD police officer. Good has said of her ancestry that her maternal grandmother is "Jewish and African. My mother's father was Cherokee and something else. My dad's mother's Puerto Rican and black, and his father was from Barbados." Good was raised with her three siblings in Canyon Country (now known as Santa Clarita), California. She began her acting career around the age of four.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/meagan-good-091af887-7a10-4ed5-9a16-344b736cf12-resize-750.jpeg><p>In the early stages of her career, Good worked as an extra on television shows such as <i>Doogie Howser, M.D.</i> and <i>Amen</i>. When she was 13, she was cast in her first film, the 1995 comedy <i>Friday</i>. She first gained critical recognition for her performance as the troubled teen Cisely Batiste in Kasi Lemmons' 1997 film <i>Eve's Bayou</i>; she received two award nominations, including her first NAACP Image Award nomination. According to Good, she grew up "super nerdy, super skinny, buckteeth, big ole afro and yet I had a sense of confidence about myself, like, 'they just don't get it yet'<span>"</span>. She was a fan of Justin Timberlake and Usher in her teens. Good did not have any role models until early adulthood, when she began admiring actress Charlize Theron.</p><h2 class=alchetronTopicHeaderClass id=Career-as-an-adult>Career as an adult</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/meagan-good-8c7f3946-a6da-4f11-b0b0-b08635cc87b-resize-750.jpeg><p>After taking on small film and television roles for the next few years, Good began to transition into more mature roles in the early 2000s. Good believes she was able to move into adult roles due to playing characters several years younger than her. From 1998 to 2001, she appeared as Nina on Nickelodeon's hit show <i>Cousin Skeeter</i>. Good later took on small roles in the films <i>3 Strikes</i> and <i>House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/meagan-good-4d8b8839-ac18-4fd1-9ae8-bb503629eaa-resize-750.jpg><p>In 2003, a major year for Good, she landed roles in the action-drama <i>Biker Boyz</i> and the romantic-comedy <i>Deliver Us from Eva</i>, which helped her transition from child to adult actress. She also appeared as the character Vanessa for five episodes during the third season of <i>My Wife and Kids</i>, before being replaced by Brooklyn Sudano for unknown reasons. In 2004, Good starred alongside Jordana Brewster, Sara Foster, and Jill Ritchie in the action film <i>D.E.B.S.</i>, and received a Best Actress nomination at the 2005 Black Movie Awards. She also had small roles in <i>The Cookout</i>, Lance "Un" Rivera's directorial debut, and the teen dance film <i>You Got Served</i>.</p><p>In 2005, Good co-starred in the horror film <i>Venom</i>, as well as the well-received neo noir <i>Brick</i>. She played opposite rapper/actor Bow Wow in Malcolm D. Lee's <i>Roll Bounce</i>. In 2006, Good played the role of Coco, which she felt was her first true lead actress role, in the urban action-drama <i>Waist Deep</i>. Good also voiced a character for the video game <i>Scarface: The World Is Yours</i> that same year. The following year, Good landed a role in the dance movie <i>Stomp the Yard</i>, starring with Ne-Yo and childhood friend Columbus Short. In 2008, Good appeared in the horror film <i>One Missed Call</i> as the ill-fated college student, Shelley Baum. She also appeared as an angry trophy wife in the Mike Myers comedy <i>The Love Guru</i>, and in the latter half of the year could be seen in <i>Saw V</i>. Good also starred in 2009's <i>The Unborn</i> with Gary Oldman and Odette Yustman.</p><p>She was part of the ensemble cast in 2012's <i>Think Like a Man,</i> a movie based on Steve Harvey's 2009 book <i>Act like a Lady, Think like a Man</i>. In 2013, Good starred in Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues. Good returned to television from January to March 2013, starring in <i>Deception</i>. Good was contacted by her agents about the series while leaving a hair salon. She sat in her car "and cried for 30-minutes like a nerd, by myself.” In 2014, Good reprised her role for the <i>Think Like a Man</i> sequel. Good stated she "had a really good time" while filming the sequel after initially being nervous "because there's so much energy that only Vegas can give." Filming <i>Think Like a Man Too</i> was Good's first time in Las Vegas shortly before she got married.</p><p>Good has also appeared in many music videos, by artists such as 50 Cent, (21 Questions), Imajin, Isyss (of which Good's sister La'Myia Good is a member), Lil' Johnny, Memphis Bleek, Tyrese, and Will Smith.</p><p>She has started her own production company, Freedom Bridge Entertainment, with Marlon Olivera and fellow actors Tamara Bass and Ty Hodges.</p><p>Good wore a royal blue dress designed by Michael Costello to the June 30, 2013 BET Awards ceremony. The dress, which featured a plunging neckline down to her midriff and a front slit that rose to midthigh, was described as "raunchy." It was sometimes compared to the Green Versace dress worn by Jennifer Lopez to the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2000. <i>Fashion & Style</i> editors selected Good as "worst dressed" at the ceremony.</p><p>The dress was controversial also because Good was presenting the BET Award for Best Gospel Artist. According to Christine Thomasos of <i>The Christian Post</i>, Good has a history of defending her stylistic choices of presenting herself as a "sexy Christian". She had said earlier that year,</p><p>"there is a classy way to do everything and there is nothing wrong with being sexy or having sex appeal and I think that I am definitely going to be someone who is boldly going to go out to the masses and be someone who say, 'Look! Women its okay'..."</p><p>Good responded on Instagram, expressing sadness that judgment had been passed on her, her character and her husband over what she wore to the ceremony. She said she picked the dress because she liked it and tried to express her individuality in her dress.</p><p>In 2014, she, along with Hill Harper contributed to the bestselling book by Enitan Bereola II., <i>Gentlewoman: Etiquette for a Lady, from a Gentleman</i><i>.</i></p><h2 class=alchetronTopicHeaderClass id=Personal-life>Personal life</h2><p>Although she was not raised in the church, Good is a Christian, considers herself a very spiritual person and has stated in numerous interviews that she would not play roles that she feels might "disappoint God". She explained in an interview that Jesus tops her hero list and the last book she read was the Bible.</p><p>Good at age 22 chose to focus on her career rather than dating, as she explained in a 2004 interview. In 2011, Good began dating DeVon Franklin, an executive for Columbia Pictures and Seventh-day Adventist preacher. They became engaged in early April 2012, and were married on June 16, 2012, at Triunfo Creek Winery in Malibu, California. They have stated that they remained chaste prior to their marriage. They live together in Los Angeles, California.</p><h2 class=alchetronTopicHeaderClass id=Video-games>Video games</h2><li><i>Scarface: The Would Is Yours</i>, 2006</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnJi1psDRqKVnm5%2BifI6xwKCYp2V3pLyl</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeagan-good.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeagan-good.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeagan-good.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeagan-good.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeagan-good.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeagan-good.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-top-10-greatest-pokemon-of-all-time.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-top-10-greatest-pokemon-of-all-time.html>The Top 10 Greatest Pokemon of All-Time</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jessyka-guevara.html>Jessyka Guevara</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jessyka-guevara.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
