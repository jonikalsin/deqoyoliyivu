They described their encounter as <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/2558447/who-suzanne-somers-husband-alan-hamel/>love at first sight</a>.</p><p class=Fg>The couple married in 1977 after living together for ten years. They had a loving relationship, but things were not always rosy especially at the beginning of their marriage when they had to blend their families. Somers <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.closerweekly.com/posts/suzanne-somers-reveals-how-she-saved-her-marriage-to-husband-alan-hamel-56135/>confessed</a> that the integration was "stepfamily hell."</p><p class=Fg>The health enthusiast had one son with her first husband, and Hamel had two children from his previous union with Marilyn Hamel. Somers revealed that blending families and divorcing was a new phenomenon then, so there were not many conversations on how to transition smoothly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/9063290ab6941b8777419b5014305a54.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Suzanne Somers with her son Bruce Somers Jr. in Los Angeles in 2003. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>The actress confessed that her parenting style clashed with Hamel's.

The couple knew that healing took time, but with patience and therapy, they introspected on what was "holding them back."</p><p class=Fg>Somers and Hamel were happy to overcome this obstacle. Even though the actress said she "marveled" at how successfully they connected their family, she understood that no family was perfect and did her best to make her marriage work.</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>Inside Suzanne Somers and Alan Hamel's Blissful Marriage</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>Sommers and Hamel dated for ten years and were married for 45, but their marriage felt like it was in it's in its honeymoon phase until the end. According to the actress, the secret to keeping the spark alive was giving each other attention; something she said <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/suzanne-somers-25-things-you-dont-know-about-me/>most couples neglected</a>.</p><p class=Fg>But for the couple, it came naturally. Somers <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/suzanne-somers-25-things-you-dont-know-about-me/>admitted</a>, "I love to hug him and rub his hair. He tells me I'm beautiful all the time, and we hold hands while we sleep. It's the most beautiful part of my life."</p><p class=Fg>The actress added that they sometimes even hold hands all night. But another way the couple kept their marriage thriving was with constant date nights.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/21b9a35287803153d1407067e0a6c9a16e12f1a0ed7e67179d2f1dca58a48e9d.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Suzanne Somers and husband Alan Hamel in California 1991 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>Somers revealed that every day is date night. Some days, they met at a nearby bar, had a strong drink, and danced. On the nights spent at home, she would make a nice dinner paired with cocktails, and they would dance around the house.</p><p class=Fg>Somers spent a typical Sunday in her vegetable garden, but her favorite room in her house was the dining room, where her family of 18 got to sit around the table, share conversations, and enjoy food.</p><p class=Fg>The couple learned the kind of life they wanted in their older years. After they spent most of their time going on back-to-back trips and attending multiple speaking engagements, they realized they preferred quiet nights together. Additionally, the years they spent together have only brought them closer and made them more comfortable around one another.</p><p class=Fg>Somers and Hamel said that their lasting youthfulness came from their organic diet, supplements, and yoga to help them get rid of stress. The couple's intimacy also came from how they constantly affirmed each other. Even though Somers' body changed over the years, her husband told her how perfect it was every day, which mattered to her.</p><p class=Fg>Somers and Hamel were grandparents of six ranging from 12 to 23 years old. What the actress loved the most about being a grandmother was the <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/suzanne-somers-favorite-part-being-grandmother/>innocent love</a> she shared with them because "kids don't know blood."</p><p class=Fg>After years of clashing, Somers was proud of how connected her blended family was, and seeing them all gathered together was her <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/suzanne-somers-favorite-part-being-grandmother/>greatest achievement</a>.</p><p class=Fg><a class="Xd a" href=#>Somers</a> and Hamel were together for almost half a century, and when asked if there was anything she wished she had known earlier in her marriage. The "Three's Company" alum said there was no recipe for a perfect marriage because she and Hamel would "<a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/books/suzanne-somers-shares-secret-40-year-marriage-sex-every-day/>fight like dogs</a>" at the beginning of their relationship.</p><p class=Fg>But once they tied the knot, they faced the challenges of building a business together and blending families, which brought more lessons. However, they always loved each other and never gave up, and 50 years later, they were happier than ever.</p><p class=Fg>Unfortunately, Hamel had to say goodbye to his beloved wife when she lost her battle with breast cancer on 15, October 2023 at 76. Somers passed just a day before her birthday, and her publicist, R. Couri Hay, released a statement announcing the actress' death and <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/suzanne-somers-dead-at-76-8358227>wrote</a>;</p><p class=Fg>“Suzanne Somers passed away peacefully at home in the early morning hours of October 15th. She survived an aggressive form of breast cancer for over 23 years. Suzanne was surrounded by her loving husband Alan, her son Bruce, and her immediate family.”</p><p class=Fg>For her birthday, the family came together to celebrate Somers' life. They also used this moment to thank her fans for their continuous support throughout her career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwcHFjaXq0wdmapaedXai8rrHRrGSsqJ%2BqwKZ5k25ksp2Rp8Buw8eoZKGZppp7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f297934-suzanne-somers-spouse-45-years-who-have-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f297934-suzanne-somers-spouse-45-years-who-have-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f297934-suzanne-somers-spouse-45-years-who-have-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f297934-suzanne-somers-spouse-45-years-who-have-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f297934-suzanne-somers-spouse-45-years-who-have-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f297934-suzanne-somers-spouse-45-years-who-have-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./taylor-dye.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./taylor-dye.html>Taylor Dye-Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Divorcee, Nationality, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./katy-humpage.html>Katy Humpage - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Married, Nationality, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./katy-humpage.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
